	abstract = "In practical calculations, it is often essential to introduce artificial boundaries to limit the area of computation. Here we develop a systematic method for obtaining a hierarchy of local boundary conditions at these artificial boundaries. These boundary conditions not only guarantee stable difference approximations but also minimize the (unphysical) artificial reflections which occur at the boundaries.",

abstract="In this paper we survey the development of fast iterative solvers aimed at solving 2D/3D Helmholtz problems. In the first half of the paper, a survey on some recently developed methods is given. The second half of the paper focuses on the development of the shifted Laplacian preconditioner used to accelerate the convergence of Krylov subspace methods applied to the Helmholtz equation. Numerical examples are given for some difficult problems, which had not been solved iteratively before.",
