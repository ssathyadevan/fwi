TODO:
-Bernhard: where to put documentation/papers?
-Document the source implementation + future work:
	o Always include receivers in the domain (for calculating pData) + calculate pData
	o Look into setting the effect of the source outside the domain as BC instead of including whole domain
	o (Improve performance by choosing different matrix solver)
